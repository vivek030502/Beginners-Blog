      "Nowadays the Castello Sforzessco, the city’s former fifteenth-century defensive fortress, is now a place where art can be relished in several first-class museums. The most prized artworks are certainly Leonardo's Sala delle Asse and Michelangelo's Pietà Rondanini, but many other great Masters are represented. The Castello is also a place to enjoy in the open, pausing to take in the spectacular courtyards, embraced by the massive walls.",

      "Online shopping is a form of electronic commerce which allows consumers to directly buy goods or services from a seller over the Internet using a web browser or a mobile app. Consumers find a product of interest by visiting the website of the retailer directly or by searching among alternative vendors using a shopping search engine, which displays the same product's availability and pricing at different e-retailers. As of 2020, customers can shop online using a range of different computers and devices, including desktop computers, laptops, tablet computers and smartphones.",
